* Hello Org Log
  Thursday, December 28, 2017.

  So this is me trying to learn how to blog some links with commentary without
  leaving Emacs.

  When I say Emacs from now on I mean "my l33t h4x0r Remacs HEAD +
  Spacemacs@develop super duper setup."

  What that really means is that I'm a n00b who didn't want to start with
  "vanilla" Emacs and spend the next year setting it up, and just went with the
  "batteries included" approach.

  It seems like Spacemacs is the Ubuntu of Emacs, and I'm all for (K|)Ubuntus.

  Now, building Remacs and switching to the develop branch of Spacemacs was so
  breezeful and piece-of-cakely that it barely counts towards my street credit
  score. It does hugely towards their developers' though.

  Thank you, Wilfred Hughes, Sylvian Benner, et al. üôè

** One Org File
   What I know about org-mode so far is that it's a tree of stuff. That's about
   it.

   So for now this log will be a single org file that I'll push to Github (much
   to the chagrin of whom's name I'm deliberately not camel-caseing).

   The single org-file structure seems to have worked pretty well for [[http://endlessparentheses.com/how-i-blog-one-year-of-posts-in-a-single-org-file.html][Mr.
   Malabarba]], so let's start there.

   Of course, his setup is light-years ahead of anything I could dream of coming
   up with, but hey, gotta start somewhere.

   Github automatically adds `#` links to headings, so each post gets its own URL. This is the simplest Org blog that could possibly work.

** TODOs
   What's an Org file without a bunch of TODOs?

*** TODO Figure out how to commit and push from within Emacs (no idea how to use Magit yet.)
*** TODO Figure out how to properly timestamp org-mode headings.
*** TODO Figure out how to display and input emojis on Emacs.
    Seriously, this is not built in?? Where are your priorities, people? ü§®

    Give Remacs a try, you've got nothing to lose!

    It's super easy to set up, won't break your Spacemacs, tracks the Emacs repo
    so you're always up to date, and... it's like Servo, but for Emacs, right?
    Gotta be good.

    Good recap on the current weekly events in Emacs world. Also includes
    Spacemacs links. Lots of advanced stuff, but nice for getting up to speed
    with the community side of things.
